# Applied-DS-Capstone-Project

Applied Data Scientist Capstone Project made for completing IBM Data Science Professional Certificate with Coursera



This project is part of **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.

This project contains all the related files and **Python code notebooks** .

The project is about:

**Project background and context**

Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. This goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully.

**Problems you want to find answers**

    What factors determine if the rocket will land successfully?
    
    The interaction amongst thvarious features at determine the success rate of a successful landing.
    
    What operating conditions needs to be in place to ensure a successful landing pro
